# Disclaimers
Keep in mind that:
* These recipes are suspect.  I'm not a professional programmer and the original author intended that users employ Yubnub or Quix for their custom functions.  As I'm relluctant to use external sources and/or standup my own Yubnub-like service, this effort involves modifying the original code to get it to work the way I want.
* Use these recipes at your own risk.  In many cases, you're messing with code that controls how your browser functions.
* I use the "/" key as the Gleebox trigger, so any example that uses "/" in these recipies is a reflection of how I have Gleebox configured.  By default, Gleebox uses "g" instead of "/".  I changed it to this to allow me to remove certain sites from the blacklist (I do need to add TT-RSS to that list though).
