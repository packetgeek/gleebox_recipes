These commands are implemented in the glee.js and pagecmds.js files, AFTER you've installed the gleebox extension for the Chrome browser.  To figure out the files location, run the following from your home directory:

  `find .config/ -name glee.js`

When editing the glee.js file, the new commands should be entered somewhere after the "commands: [" line.  When editing the pagecmds.js file, the new entry can be made anywhere in the file (just not inside another command, obviously).
